I visit [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) less frequently than I used to. It was at one time a permanent tab in my browser, offering a streaming drip of innovation, a glimpse at endeavours worth idealizing, and a compendium of humanity's daily triumphs. 

Some say it's gone downhill, and is now forever a mass of self referential monoculturisms and token contrarianism. I won't go that far, but I do question what it's doing to me, day by day, drip by drip.

As a now sporadic consumer of much mass and niche media I often have time to introspect. I have, at times, felt my mind compressed into a neatly composed spherical blob encompassing a societal and ideological schema, constantly scoping my thoughts within its shrinking bounds. Imagine all the things you could ever think, and now imagine a guardrail in your mind keeping you from going beyond a certain level of hilarity or insanity. Your mind slowly becomes the norm, only thinking normal things, like how important that programming paradigm is, or how lovely Christmas will be, or how awful David Cameron is.

The barely noticeable ebb of homogenisation is terrifying. So I now try to consume traditional media rarely and with perspective; I also rarely engage in online conversations anymore. I only ever feel I must when I have some lacking self affirmation. So I take to the keyboard and type my way to that sweet rush of significance and agreement. I rarely have skin in a fight -- so I give up easily -- I belive I will never persuade others when they do not seek truth but instead the same petty affirmations that I myself am reduced to. I have no faith in either the mindlessly argumentative nor the cloyingly polite for revealing and attending to the crux of an issue.

Reading through a thread of tweets or comments what ends up being revealed is not truth but instead the chaotic individualistic search for:

 * Validation
 * Affirmation
 * Promotion
 * Aspiration
 * Significance

We reveal a part of ourselves in the hopes that it improves our momentary standing in the vastness of humanity. The internet is as much a technical revolution as it is a medium of archaic human behaviour -- where biological needs are served by the endless patter of keyboards across the globe. We seek the praise of others not because it represents some objective value but because it serves the psychological need of dignity and acceptance.
