**Clarity**...<br>so rarely afforded, fleeting and drifting away as the words spill
from the mind.

**Clarity**...<br>gives you the sight to see a single thread of truth amongst a 
quilt of mayhem.

**Clarity**...<br>a peace, an underlying awareness and contentment that seeks
not ego nor gain.

**Clarity**...<br>a relief from the complexities of mankind.

PS. *Poetry always seems such a futile exercise of grandiosity and pomp...
so I'm sorry for that. I don't mean the pomp -- I just enjoy the gentle
pace and spirit of well articulated concepts through prose.*
